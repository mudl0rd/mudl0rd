## âš¡ There is no end-user support for things here.

## Why no support?

 * Designed all for own personal usage, thus no issue reports/pull requests.
 * Prefer to do all code, at own pace, in own time.
 * See [this](https://aarongiles.com/dreamm/docs/v30/#faq-opensource) for ideas why no collab.
 * **Code is pure jank** and **I prefer no one use it**, if possible, unless otherwise noted.


## Why some stuff missing?

 * Legality, to be honest. Some involve code modification/hooks of proprietary applications.
   - This also applies to some app-private APIs being reverse engineered.
 * Personal reasons (like in WTFweg's case) to keep personal to myself.
 * Some stuff I don't feel are quality enough (I know its ironic, even for me) to make public.
   - Plus I am too lazy to sort into a coherant repo for some of them.

## What do you do?

 * **I am petty enough to do things for myself, my way. No matter how wrong its done.**
 * *Experimenting* with things like:
   - Compression.
   - Audio DSP/synthesis.
   - Graphics rendering.
   - Software reverse engineering.
   - Optimization.
   - Emulation in purely jank ways.
