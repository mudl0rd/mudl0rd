## âš¡ There is no end-user support for things here.

## Why no support?

 * Personal usage only, thus no issue reports/pull requests.
 * **Code is pure jank**. And intentionally so. Code is done for intentionally unorthodox reasons.

## What do you do?

 * [**I am petty enough to do things for myself. No matter how wrongly its done.**](http://mudl0rd.github.io/WTFweg/)
 * *Experimenting* with things like:
   - Compression.
   - Audio DSP/synthesis.
   - Graphics rendering.
   - Software reverse engineering.
   - Emulation in **purely** jank ways. **Don't expect "accurate" emulation at all**.
