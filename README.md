# âš¡ There is no end-user support done here.

## Why no support?

 * Designed all for own personal usage, thus no issue reports/pull requests.
 * Prefer to do all code, at own pace, in own time.
 * See [this](https://aarongiles.com/dreamm/docs/v30/#faq-opensource) for ideas why no collab.

## What do you do?

 * **I am petty enough to do things for myself, my way. No matter how wrong the way is to do.**
 * *Experimenting* with things like:
   - Compression.
   - Audio DSP/synthesis.
   - Graphics rendering.
   - Software reverse engineering.
   - Optimization.
   - Emulation in an unorthodox manner.
